# Reddit Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot I made that would at random times either post a random shower thought from the reddit board showerthoughts or it would share a random photo from the reddit board me_irl.

This bot could definatly be modified to support different reddit boards and different commands.

currently the bot relays on bash scripts and text files in order to get its reddit posts but Im sure in the future I can modify it to use the [praw api](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw) to directly pull the data from reddit.
